# Project Plan: A Production-Grade Gmail MCP Server in Java

This document outlines the strategic rationale and a detailed, phased development plan for creating a robust, open-source Gmail MCP Server using the Java ecosystem.

## Phased Development Plan & Work Breakdown

The project is broken down into four logical phases, each with a set of actionable issues designed to be completed in sequence.

### Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication

**Goal:** Establish a working, secure project skeleton that can successfully authenticate with the Google Gmail API via the OAuth 2.0 protocol for installed applications.

- [x] **Issue #1: Project Scaffolding & Dependency Setup**
- [x] **Issue #2: Google Cloud Project Setup & Documentation**
- [x] **Issue #3: Core Authentication Service (GoogleAuthService)**

### Phase 2: Core Email Functionality (MCP Tools)

**Goal:** Implement the essential email operations as discoverable, callable, and well-described MCP Tools.

- [x] **Issue #4: Implement GmailToolService and sendEmail Tool** ([test](src/test/java/com/example/gmailmcp/service/GmailToolServiceTest.java#L30))
- [x] **Issue #5: Implement Read & Search Tools** ([test](src/test/java/com/example/gmailmcp/service/GmailToolServiceTest.java#L39))
- [x] **Issue #6: Implement Email Management Tools** ([test](src/test/java/com/example/gmailmcp/service/GmailToolServiceTest.java#L55))

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Refinements

**Goal:** Enhance the server with high-value features that demonstrate complex interactions and improve robustness.

- [x] **Issue #7: Attachment Handling** ([test](src/test/java/com/example/gmailmcp/service/GmailToolServiceTest.java#L86))
- [ ] **Issue #8: (Optional Stretch Goal) Calendar Integration**
- [ ] **Issue #9: Robust Configuration & Usability**

### Phase 4: Packaging, Documentation & Release

**Goal:** Prepare the server for public consumption, ensuring it is easy to deploy, use, and understand.

- [ ] **Issue #10: Containerization with Docker**
- [x] **Issue #11: Finalize README and User Documentation**
- [ ] **Issue #12: Testing, Release, and Community Engagement**
