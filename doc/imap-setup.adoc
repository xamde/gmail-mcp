= Local IMAP Repository Setup

This document describes how to set up and use the local IMAP repository.

== Overview

The local IMAP repository stores emails and their attachments locally on your file system. It uses Apache Lucene to provide full-text search capabilities.

== Data Storage

The local repository consists of two main parts:

1.  *File Repository:* This is where the actual emails and their attachments are stored.
2.  *Search Index:* This is a Lucene index that allows for fast searching of emails.

Both of these are created in the directory you specify when you create a `LocalEmailRepository` instance.

=== File Repository Structure

The file repository is structured as follows:

----
<repository-path>/
|-- <email-id-1>/
|   |-- message.json
|   `-- attachments/
|       |-- <attachment-1-filename>
|       `-- <attachment-2-filename>
|-- <email-id-2>/
|   |-- message.json
|   `-- attachments/
|       `-- <attachment-1-filename>
...
----

*   `<repository-path>`: The root directory of the file repository.
*   `<email-id>`: A unique identifier for each email.
*   `message.json`: A JSON file containing the metadata of the email (from, to, subject, body, etc.).
*   `attachments/`: A directory containing all the attachments for the email.

=== Search Index

The search index is a Lucene index stored at the specified index path. It contains indexed data from the emails to allow for fast searching.

== Usage

To use the local IMAP repository, you need to create an instance of the `com.example.gmailmcp.repository.LocalEmailRepository` class, providing the paths to the file repository and the search index.

[source,java]
----
import com.example.gmailmcp.repository.LocalEmailRepository;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

// ...

Path repositoryPath = Paths.get("/path/to/your/repo");
Path indexPath = Paths.get("/path/to/your/index");
LocalEmailRepository localEmailRepository = new LocalEmailRepository(repositoryPath, indexPath);
----

You can then use the methods of the `LocalEmailRepository` to add, search, retrieve, and delete emails.
